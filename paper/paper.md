# Summary
Scientific simulations generate large volume of data that needs to be stored and processed
by multidisciplinary teams across different geographical locations. Distributing
computational expensive simulations among the available resources, avoiding duplication
and keeping the data safe are challenges that scientists face every day.

Ceiba and its command line interface Ceiba-cl solve the problem of computing,
storing and securely sharing computationally expensive simulation results. Researchers
can save significant time and resources by easily computing new data and reusing existing
simulation data to answer their questions.

Ceiba is implemented in Python using the Tartiflete GraphQL server.

# Statement of need

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
