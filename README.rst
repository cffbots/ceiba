Most of the scientific simulations are usually performed in supercomputer
or high tech facilities. Usually the data is kept on those facilities
stored in a raw format, in contraction with the
`scientific FAIR principles for data <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>`_.

This web service provides an interface to store and retrieve data from a 
database, without the manual intervention of the researcher.

Installation
