Queries
#######
Queries are defined using the `schema definition language <https://graphql.org/learn/schema/>`_.
You can find the mutations definition `ceiba/sdl/Query.graphql <https://github.com/nlesc-nano/ceiba/blob/main/ceiba/sdl/Query.graphql>`_

Queries involved *read-only* interactions between the client and the database.
