Mutations
#########
Mutations are defined using the `schema definition language <https://graphql.org/learn/schema/>`_.
You can find the mutations definition at `insilicoservice/sdl/Mutation.graphql <https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/blob/master/insilicoserver/sdl/Query.graphql>`_

Mutations involved a change in the database state, requested by the client. **All the mutations required authentication**.
